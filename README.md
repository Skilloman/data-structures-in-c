# Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing in C various data structures.

## Sequential Data Structures

In this section, you can find implementations of various sequential data structures. Here's what's available so far:

- **Linked List:** Implementation of a singly linked list, a fundamental linear data structure.
- **Queue:** Implementation of a queue, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Stack:** Implementation of a stack, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Vector:** Implementation of a dynamic array that can grow or (soon) shrink as needed.

## Hierarchical Data Structures

Currently, this section is under development.

### Upcoming

- **Hashtable:** Implementation of a hashtable, a data structure used for efficient key-value pair storage.
- **Vector:** Possibility of shrinking the vector.
- Some hierarchical data structures.
- Get element by index in Linked List
